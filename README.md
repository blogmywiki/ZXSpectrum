# ZXSpectrum
Dumping ground for my original 1980s ZX Spectrum code.

I think the 'psioed' font editor is the 'Character Generator' in the Psion Horizons cassette. Written in BASIC. Not by me!

'htv-logo' and 'c4-logo' are BASIC programs for drawing TV company logos.

VSavon and Holly Tree are imaginary TV company logos, the former looks like it was coded by Mark Owen, I think the latter by Bruce Guthrie.
