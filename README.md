# ZX Spectrum programs and fonts
Dumping ground for original 1980s ZX Spectrum code from around 1982, transferred from cassettes in my loft. Mostly, so far, written by my school friend Mark Owen (not that one), a few by me or another friend.

I think the 'psioed' font editor could be the 'Character Generator' in the Psion Horizons cassette. Written in BASIC. Not by me! There's a sugegstion this could be an adapted version of the one on the Horizons tape, allowing more characters to be edited, so I'll keep it here for now in case it's of wider interest.

'3d0x' is an elegant 3D noughts and crosses program by Mark Owen.

'affonsid' - BASIC program by me to draw an imaginary TV company logo VERY slowly using circles.

'colorbars' is an odd 1 line BASIC program which draws horizontal colour bars *in the border*.

'c4-logo' and 'htv-logo' are BASIC programs for drawing TV company logos.

'dotman' is a BASIC game, not written by me - maybe a magazine type-in?

'g3nxu' is a BASIC program by Mark Owen to draw colour bars and my dad's ham radio callsign, for use in amateur TV transmissions.

'Gorilla', another BASIC game on a cassette in the loft. A magazine type in? Written by Mark Owen? Or could it be this? https://worldofspectrum.net/item/0020215/

'mazegen' - Mark Owen BASIC program to generate mazes of different sizes

'testcard' - simple B&W TV testcard with squares, circles and gradients. I may have written this one! Likely used for amateur TV transmissions.

VSavon and Holly Tree are imaginary TV company logos, the former looks like it was coded by Mark Owen, I think the latter by Bruce Guthrie. It looks like Mark's VSavon code also reprograms a character to be the Avonside logo once you run it - compare the REM in line 125 before and after you run it!

'Oinvaders' (Zappovaders?) is a space invaders type game written by Mark Owen in BASIC with a machine code element 'MC1' which gets loaded - hence the WAV file rather than .tap - this seems to load ok in FUSE.

'swarm' is The Swarm, a space-invaders-like game written in BASIC, again not by me. No credits. Mark Owen again maybe?

'vhs?!â€½?' is a BASIC program to draw a Sony Betamax logo - Mark Owen must have written this as he was always wanging on about how superior Betamax was to VHS. Also, note the early use of the interrobang, there.

'vs-lander' is a BASIC lunar lander program by Mark Owen.

'wonder-scroller' is a Mark Owen demo to scroll text one pixel at a time, I think by manipulating the fonts.

## Inline font 
'inline' is a Broadway-like font, which I am 99% sure I made. Happy to correct if it wasn't me! This loads ok using typeface-loader or loading it in location 31231 and doing POKE 23607,121 

'inline-2' is the same font shifted 1 byte later so it loads ok by dragging and dropping onto screenshots such as https://damieng.com/typography/zx-origins/homestead/
